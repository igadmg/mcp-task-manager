description: Execute all pending tasks using superpowers workflow
---

Use the packaged `superpowers-workflow` skill from the `mcp-task-manager` Codex plugin to execute all pending tasks from the task manager MCP server.

Expected setup:
- Install the plugin from this marketplace with `/plugin install mcp-task-manager@mcp-task-manager`
- Make sure the `mcp-task-manager` binary is installed so the packaged `.mcp.json` can launch the `task-manager` server
- Use `$install-agents` after installing or upgrading the plugin so `planner`, `coder`, and `reviewer` are registered in `~/.codex/agents/`

The workflow will:
1. Get the next todo task from the task manager
2. If it's a parent task without subtasks: dispatch the configured `planner` custom agent to create implementation subtasks
3. Execute each subtask with the configured `coder` custom agent and review it with the configured `reviewer` custom agent when the workflow requires review
4. If a preferred custom role agent is unavailable: stop and ask the user before allowing any fallback
5. Continue until all tasks are complete
